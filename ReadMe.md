# FrontEnd Masters | Python Fundamentals #
## by Nina Zakharenko ##

I am following the [Frontend Master's](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/python/) Python Fundamentals taught by Nina Zakharenko, and will try to finish all the course under this track to increase my understanding of the Python language. I am not aware of any copyright issues, but will upload in my Github profile for the version control on my study.

This is a notes taking repository which will have code and my understanding of the course. Kindly mail me if there an issue with copyright will try to remove it.
